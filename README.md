# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Welcome to my HTML and CSS projects repository! Here you will find a collection of sample websites that I have created throughout my bootcamp journey.

## Projects
1. [Isekai Isekai] 
2. [Movie Theater Site]

### Isekai Site
This website is about having a chance to live in a fantasy world. It is styled using CSS and includes various web components such as navigation bar, hero image, and responsive layout design.

### Movie Theater Site
This page is an example of a theater website made using Bootstrap 4. It contains a number of components and utilities such as carousel, cards, and modals. The website is also fully responsive and can be viewed on different devices.

I hope you enjoy browsing through my projects. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback. Thank you for visiting!
